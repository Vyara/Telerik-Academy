Problem 11. Programming Languages

Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.


1. Java
Compiled static object-oriented language like C#, both languages have many similarities in syntax. In C# the Main() method can be declared without parameters. Both languages are compiled to bytecode(unlike other languages that require a separate compiler for each computer plattform).

2. PHP
Unlike C#,which is a compiled language, PHP is a dynamic interpreted language and is mainly used for web development(it is a server-side scripting labguage), but can be also used as a general-purpose programming language. There are some similiarities in syntax.

3. C++
Both C++ and C# are compiled languages, but C++ is generally compiled to native code, where C# is compiled to bytecode. There are some similarities in syntax. C# is a more readable, higher level language and allows, among other things, a higher level of abstraction. 

4. C
Low level static compiled language, it is a standart, cross-plattform language. Unlike C#, C doesn't include object orientation and garbage collection and generally has some basic functions, without including some more advanced features of the newer languages.

5. Python
Python is a high level, dynamic interpreted language, very readable, which makes it great for learning purposes(very similar to Ruby). It uses indentation to separate program blocks, doesn't require brackets or (;). Compiled languages are commonly considered as being faster and more reliable, while the interpreted ones are easier to implement and allow easier debugging.
