﻿//Problem 14.* Print the ASCII Table

//Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console (characters from 0 to 255).
//Note: Some characters have a special purpose and will not be displayed as expected. You may skip them or display them differently.

using System;

    static void Main()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++)
        {   
            char ascii = (char)i;
            Console.WriteLine("Decimal: {0}" + " " + "ASCII: {1}", i, ascii);
