##1. Game Description
A Flappy-bird like game, where your goal is to drink as much as possible cocktails in order to win the game. While performing this heroic task the player must avoid many obstacles and defy the increasing gravity pull by hitting the space button.
Soft drinks shrink the size of the bird, while cocktails enlarge it. Upon shrinking to a minimum size, the game ends. Obstacles move both on the upper and the lower end of the game screen. If the bird collides with an obstacle, it dies and the game ends.
