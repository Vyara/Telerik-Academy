	•	PROJECT EXPLANATION
	The project represents an application for organizing events written in C# programming language.

	Application functionalities:
	Event organization and planning
	Three types of users with different access levels (admin, organizer, participant)
	Staff hierarchy 
	Different types of participant categorization
	Transport management
	User data arrangement and preservation
	
	Users:
	Administrators – they can manage all the data available in the application
	Organizers – they can change the meeting points and confirm if a participant has paid the required fee.
	Participants – they can add their names in the list of participants and information about if they use private transport and the number of seats available.
	*The administrators and the organizers can login using a special login form. The participants can add their names and other necessary information about them in the event data without the need to login. 
	
	Event data:
	Name – the name of the event
	Date – date and time when the event begins
	Location – GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the place with the name of the venue (optional).
	Organizer – the name of the organizer of the event
	List of participants – all participants attending the event
	Staff list – list of the staff in charge of organizing the event
	Meting point – the place where all the participants depart
	Budget – the total amount of money needed
	
	Staff data:
	
					Event staff
						/	\
		Animation staff		Restaurant staff
				/	\			/	\
			DJ		Singer	Cook	Waiter
	
	Event staff – all the people in charge of organizing the event

	•	OTHER INFORMATION
	
	o	Requirements fulfilled
		
		•	At least 5 interfaces (with one or more implementations)
		•	At least 15 classes (implementing the application logic)
		•	At least 3 abstract classes (with inheritors)
		•	At least 1 custom exception class (with usage in your code)
		•	At least 3 levels of depth in inheritance
		•	At least 1 polymorphism usage
		•	At least 1 structure
		•	At least 1 enumeration
		•	At least 1 event (with subscribers)
		•	At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command,  etc.)

		
		ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
		•	Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly,
		use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, 
		follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
		•	Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use https://github.com/). 
		TFS or SVN are not allowed. Use Git.
		•	Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types).

		OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
		If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:
		•	Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
		•	Constants, generic types, indexers, operators
		•	Lambda expressions and LINQ
		•	Implementation of IEnumerable<T>, ICloneable, ToString() override
		•	Namespaces (if your classes are too much) 
		•	User interface (UI) – console, graphical, web or mobile
